# koma 0.3.1

* Added `\value` documentation tags to `print.koma_forecast` and `print.koma_seq` to comply with CRAN policy.

# koma 0.3.0

# koma 0.2.2

# koma 0.2.2.9000

# koma 0.2.2

* Fixed frequency-dependent forecasting, estimation, evaluation, weighting, and plotting paths so single-frequency monthly and yearly data work correctly.
* Fixed forecast plotting labels for non-quarterly data.
* Fixed `estimate_sem()` for multisession futures.
* Improved input validation for forecasting and `system_of_equations()`.
* Improved `koma_ts` metadata handling for attribute preservation across transformations.

# koma 0.2.1

* Fix pkgdown site build by adding package URL and completing `_pkgdown.yml` reference index.

# koma 0.2.0

* Added fan chart support in forecast plots, including density-based visuals built from stochastic draws.
* Added growth-rate whiskers to forecast plots when fan charts are enabled.
* Improved conditional forecasting behavior and messaging.
* Tightened forecast/estimation validation and fixed several forecasting edge cases.
* Expanded estimation utilities: support `ts` inputs, per-series ts→ets overrides, and richer `texreg` extracts/summaries.
* Added/updated documentation and vignettes (error correction, extract methods, and forecast output guidance).
* Reduced/adjusted dependencies (e.g., removed `expm`, `tidyr`, `stringr`; moved `plotly` to Suggests; added standalone Wishart helpers).
* Improved CI and tooling (GitHub Actions checks, codecov, release/tag workflows, and renv handling).
* Added `summary()` output for `koma_forecast` with mean/median and quantile columns.
* Added MCMC trace plots via `trace_plot()` for coefficient diagnostics.
* Added running-mean diagnostics via `running_mean()` and `running_mean_plot()`.
* Added autocorrelation diagnostics via `acf_plot()`.

# koma 0.1.0

* Initial github release.
